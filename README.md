# Lending Service challenge
Design/implement a system to manage loans.

You have been assigned to build the lending service that will be used to disburse and reimburse loans to a customer's balance.

Loans are related to a loan offer that specifies the balance disbursed to the customerand the taxes applied.

Customers request a loan related to an offer. It's not possible a customer have more than one active (pending to be repaid) loan.

Once the loan has been approvisioned, an Online Charging System (OCS) can notify the service customer's balance has received a top up
so repayment (fully or partial) should be challenged.

# API
This service must provide a REST API which will be used to interact with it.

This API must comply with the following contract:

## GET /status

Responses:
- **200 OK** When the service is ready to receive requests.

# Tooling
At MyneHub, we use Github for our backend development work. Anyways, please fork this repository and use the environment you feel more comfortable,
but please bear in ming we want to see your best!

# Requirements
- The service should be as efficient as possible. It should be able to work reasonably well with at least $`10^4`$ / $`10^5`$ customers.
  Explain how you did achieve this requirement.
- Document your decissions using PRs or in this very README adding sections to it,
  the same way you would be generating documentation for any other deliverable.
- It is supposed the service will run in-memory. In case you need any repository, please justify it.


# Solution
- I've added Entity Framework as Repository. 


# Improvements
- Apply Unit Of Work Repository.
- Apply .NET Cache for some entities. (maybe knowCustomers)
-
